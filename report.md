5. Can You Use this Data Set for Your Intended Use Case? Yes because it contains information about prices of listings,
the neighborhood of listings and the number of reviews of each listing among other things.

Columns and Expected Types based on Pandas:
- id: int64
- listing_name: string object
- host_name: string object
- neighborhood: string object
- latitude and longitude: float64
- room_type: string object
- price: int64
- minimum_nights: int64
- number_of_reviews: int64
- availability_365: int64

# Table Design

Since the csv file was cleaned up to drop nulls, all the columns have the NOT NULL constraint.

- id: set as PRIMARY KEY as it is unique and will not be changed.
- listing_name: text type as strings in column have a high deviation in length
- host_name: varchar(50). Set it as 50 as a safe choice upon inspection of column strings lengths.
- neighborhood: varchar(15). Longest named neighborhood is "Staten Island" with length 13, so chose 15 (slightly more)
  to be safe
- latitude and longitude: double precision were used as in original data structures they have variable
  precision numbers. Double precision used instead of real as it is more precise. Calculations will not be done on
  these columns (rare that it will) which is why decided not to use numeric
- room_type: max length of string in column is 15 so I chose 20 for length of varchar (extra just in case)
- price: Price in original dataset is int so left it as int
- minimum_nights: max is 1250 so chose smallint as it is sufficient to capture data
- number_of_reviews: max is 629 so chose smallint as it is sufficient to capture data (i.e. max smallint > max reviews)
- availability_365: max is 365 so chose smallint as it is sufficient to capture data

Constraints: price, minimum_nights, and availability_365 should be > 0 due to logic. If these were
0 then there is no point of that listing existing. number_of_reviews is strictly positive.

# Import

ERROR 1
homework06=# COPY air_bnb_NYC_data FROM '/Users/manjiribhandarwar/Documents/GitHub/homework06-manjiri-b/air_bnb_data_NYC.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

To fix this further cleaned up csv file, dropped rows where 'availability_365' column == 0.

ERROR 2
homework06=# COPY air_bnb_NYC_data FROM '/Users/manjiribhandarwar/Documents/GitHub/homework06-manjiri-b/air_bnb_data_NYC.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;

CONTEXT:  COPY air_bnb_nyc_data, line 321: "100184,Bienvenue,,Queens,40.72413,-73.76133,Private room,50,1,43,88"

Dropped rows with null values in host_name and listing_name column to fix this.

CONTEXT:  COPY air_bnb_nyc_data, line 7144, column listing_name: "Entire pvt. house for rent ,2 floors

```
###  4. add a new column without a default value
ALTER TABLE

Used this to check if the column was added:
homework06=# \d air_bnb_nyc_data
                          Table "public.air_bnb_nyc_data"
          Column           |         Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default
---------------------------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+---------
 id                        | integer               |           | not null |
 listing_name              | text                  |           | not null |
 host_name                 | character varying(50) |           | not null |
 neighborhood              | character varying(15) |           | not null |
 latitude                  | double precision      |           | not null |
 longitude                 | double precision      |           | not null |
 room_type                 | character varying(20) |           | not null |
 price                     | integer               |           | not null |
 minimum_nights            | smallint              |           | not null |
 number_of_reviews         | smallint              |           | not null |
 availability_365          | smallint              |           | not null |
 total_minimum_expenditure | integer               |           |          |
Indexes:
    "air_bnb_nyc_data_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
Check constraints:
    "air_bnb_nyc_data_availability_365_check" CHECK (availability_365 > 0)
    "air_bnb_nyc_data_minimum_nights_check" CHECK (minimum_nights > 0)
    "air_bnb_nyc_data_number_of_reviews_check" CHECK (number_of_reviews >= 0)
    "air_bnb_nyc_data_price_check" CHECK (price > 0)

```
```
### 5. set the value of that new column. Value of new column was set to the multiplication of the
price and minimum_nights column.

Result of Query:
UPDATE 31342

Checking if the Query Worked Properly by Displaying the first 5 rows of the price, minimum_nights and
total_minimum_expenditure columns.

homework06=# SELECT price, minimum_nights, total_minimum_expenditure FROM air_bnb_nyc_data LIMIT 5;
 price | minimum_nights | total_minimum_expenditure
-------+----------------+---------------------------
    52 |              2 |                       104
    55 |              4 |                       220
    50 |              3 |                       150
    70 |              1 |                        70
    89 |              4 |                       356
(5 rows)
```
```
### 6. show only the unique (non duplicates) of a column of your choice: neighborhood.
 neighborhood
---------------
 Bronx
 Brooklyn
 Manhattan
 Queens
 Staten Island
(5 rows)
```
```
### 7. group rows together by a column value (your choice) and use an aggregate
function to calculate something about that group.

        neighborhood;
 neighborhood  | average_price
---------------+---------------
 Queens        |        100.04
 Brooklyn      |        132.95
 Staten Island |        114.23
 Manhattan     |        214.20
 Bronx         |         89.08
(5 rows)
```
```
### 8. now, using the same grouping query or creating another one, find a way to filter the query results based on the values for the groups

Grouping query with filter result:
 neighborhood | count
--------------+-------
 Brooklyn     | 12248
 Manhattan    | 13555
(2 rows)

Grouping query without filter (as it is a new grouping query)
 neighborhood  | count
---------------+-------
 Queens        |  4297
 Brooklyn      | 12248
 Staten Island |   331
 Manhattan     | 13555
 Bronx         |   911
(5 rows)
```
```
### 9. What is the count of each room_type?
    room_type    | count
-----------------+-------
 Entire home/apt | 16525
 Shared room     |   861
 Private room    | 13956
(3 rows)
```
```
### 10.What is the average price by room_type?

    room_type    | average_price
-----------------+---------------
 Entire home/apt |        224.64
 Shared room     |         66.07
 Private room    |         93.98
(3 rows)
```
```
### 11. Most expensive listing(s) in terms of total_minimum_expenditure.

                 listing_name                 | neighborhood | total_minimum_expenditure
----------------------------------------------+--------------+---------------------------
 Luxury TriBeCa Apartment at an amazing price | Manhattan    |                   1170000
(1 row)
```
```
### 12. Least expensive listing(s) in terms of total_minimum_expenditure.

                    listing_name                    | neighborhood | total_minimum_expenditure
----------------------------------------------------+--------------+---------------------------
